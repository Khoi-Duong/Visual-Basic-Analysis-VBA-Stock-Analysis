# The VBA of Wall Street
The following code uses VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data per year. The code organizes the data into columns containing the unique ticker symbols, t yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the total stock volume of the stock.

The images are the results after running the VBA code on the generated stock market data for years 2018, 2019, and 2020. 

The VBA code itself also contains a bonus feature that outputs the ticker symbol of stocks with the greatest % increase/decrease and the greatest volume as well as the values for the greatest % increase/decrease and the greatest volume.
